## [8.0.0] — 2026-04-28

**The PARS redesign.** Full architectural reset: the dashboard moves to a React/Vite SPA layered on top of the existing Worker via Cloudflare Workers Static Assets. Single deploy, single URL, no CORS. The aesthetic flips from the prior light editorial theme to **Performance Dark** — near-black canvas, molten-orange accent, Geist + Geist Mono, instrument-panel data density. Designed for **Marco** — the performance-driven amateur cyclist (Zürich, FTP-aware, training 8–12 h/week).

### Added — frontend

- **React 19 + Vite + TypeScript strict** SPA at `apps/web`. Tanstack Router (file-based, type-safe), Tanstack Query, Motion, CSS Modules, Biome.
- **Design system v1** — single source of truth in `apps/web/src/design/tokens.{ts,css}`. Tokens for color (canvas, surface, text, accent, Coggan zones Z1–Z6, status), spacing (4 px base), radius, shadows, motion durations + easings, type scale, z-index, breakpoints.
- **Twelve base components**: `Button`, `Card`, `Container`, `Eyebrow`, `Pill`, `BikeMark`, `BottomNav` (mobile authed nav), `GrainOverlay`, `PmcStrip`, `ProgressRing`, `StatTile`, `TopBar`, `WorkoutCard`, `ZonePill`.
- **Landing** route — hero ("Train like the metrics matter"), instrument-cluster preview (live PMC + workout + ring), credentials band, FOR / NOT FOR honesty list, 3 feature spreads, BYOK pricing, final CTA, editorial footer.
- **Privacy** route — editorial sections, success/warn callout boxes, mono code spans.
- **Dashboard** route — see "Dashboard sections" below.

### Added — dashboard sections

1. **Hero fold** — italic greeting, PMC strip (CTL · ATL · TSB with 7-day deltas), 4 quick stats, goal-event countdown, yearly km goal ring with projected year-end.
2. **Today's workout** — uses the AI-generated plan when available, falls back to a sample WorkoutCard.
3. **Streak heatmap** — 12 weeks × 7 days, 5 intensity buckets, current/best/total numbers, today cell pulses.
4. **Wins timeline** — last 90 days of PRs surfaced as a feed.
5. **Volume chart** — distance + elevation bars, weekly/monthly toggle, 12-bucket window, totals header.
6. **AI Coach** — three states: BYOK setup → sessions/week picker (1–7 with hint copy) + Generate → full plan render (summary, strengths, areas to improve, 7-day plan with today highlight, motivation, regenerate).
7. **Routes for today** — saved routes scored against today's plan + surface preference (Tarmac/Gravel/Any) + start address. Match % per row, top-3 default with "Show all".
8. **Recents** — 8 most recent rides with inline "Get coach verdict" panel calling `/coach-ride`.

### Added — backend / infra

- **Workers Static Assets** in `wrangler.jsonc` (replaces the legacy CF Pages flow). Single Worker serves SPA + API. `run_worker_first` lists OAuth + API + AI + webhook paths.
- **`migrations/0001_pmc_and_events.sql`** — schema v2 adds `users.ftp_w / weight_kg / hr_max`, `activities.tss / np_w / if_pct / duration_s / primary_zone`, new `daily_load` PMC rollup table, event-extension columns on `goals`. *(Migration ready; not auto-applied. Apply with `wrangler d1 execute`.)*
- **`/authorize` + `/callback` honor `?origin=`** so OAuth redirect_uri returns to the user's actual host (works in Vite dev at :5173 even though Worker runs at :8787). Origin is base64-JSON-encoded into Strava's `state` param to survive the round-trip. Strict allowlist: only localhost loopbacks accepted.
- **Concurrent dev** — `npm run dev:all` boots Worker + Vite together via `concurrently`. Vite proxies `/api`, `/authorize`, `/callback`, `/refresh`, `/coach`, `/coach-ride`, `/version`, `/webhook` to the Worker.

### Changed

- **Type stack**: Geist (UI) + Geist Mono (numerals). Two families. Inter is gone.
- **Color**: dark canvas + molten orange `#ff4d00`. Strava brand orange `#fc4c02` retained but reserved for Strava-specific UI (sync indicators, attribution).
- **Build & deploy**: root `package.json` adds `dev:web`, `dev:worker`, `dev:all`, `build:web`, `build`, `deploy` scripts. Single `npm run deploy` builds the SPA then `wrangler deploy`s the Worker with assets attached.

### Restored from v7 (after the initial redesign dropped them)

- AI weekly plan generator (sessions-per-week picker, full plan render).
- Per-ride AI feedback (verdict + concrete next-time suggestion).
- Streak heatmap.
- Wins timeline.
- Volume chart.
- Saved routes picker with surface + start-address preferences.
- All preferences keyed under `cc_*` localStorage to maintain compatibility with the legacy Worker's keys.

### Persona-driven design decisions

- **Mono for every numeral** — like a Garmin Edge / Wahoo BOLT screen.
- **No emoji as visual currency** — replaced with crafted SVG glyphs (BikeMark, ★, ◆).
- **Square-ish radii** (max 16 px) — instrument-coded, not bubble-shaped.
- **Italic flourishes only on emphasis words** — italic = brand inflection, not body copy.
- **Topographic SVG behind the landing hero** — Ordnance Survey / cycling-map atmosphere.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` zeroes every duration** in CSS — single guard, never per-component.

### Known limitations / next up

- Dashboard renders **seeded Marco-Bianchi mock data** by default. The real-data swap (live `/api/athlete` + `/api/athlete/activities` via Tanstack Query) is wired in `lib/api.ts` and `lib/auth.ts` but not yet hot-swapped at the page level. Apply schema v2 migration first, then flip the toggle.
- TSS backfill from existing `strava_raw_json` — schema columns added, backfill script not yet written.
- Strava 7-zone power model — currently using Coggan's 6 (Z1–Z6). Z7 token + ingestion pending. See `lib/zones.ts`.
- The legacy `landingPage()` / `dashboardPage()` / `privacyPage()` functions in `src/worker.js` are unreachable under Workers Static Assets but still bundled. Pruning them is a follow-up.
- Cloudflare Pages app's previous CI build command may still be `wrangler deploy` only — update Workers & Pages → cycling-coach → Settings → Builds → Build command to `npm run build:web` for full CI/CD.
